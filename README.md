# Genome Sequencing Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Genome Sequencing Analysis repository! This repository contains a Python notebook that performs analysis on genome sequencing data. In this README file, you will find information about genomics, the dataset used for analysis, and how to navigate the repository.

### What is Genome and Genomics?
- **Genome**: The genome refers to the complete set of DNA within an organism, including all of its genes. It contains all the information needed for an organism to develop, function, and reproduce.
- **Genomics**: Genomics is the branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes. It involves studying the entirety of an organism's DNA sequence.

### Human Genome
- The human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans, encoded as DNA within the 23 pairs of chromosomes in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria.
- It comprises both coding regions (genes) and noncoding regions, which regulate gene expression and have other functions.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used for analysis in this repository represents a sequence of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) extracted from the genome. Each SNP is represented by one of the following symbols:
- A: Adenine
- C: Cytosine
- G: Guanine
- T: Thymine
- D: Base deletions
- I: Base insertions
- `_` or `-`: Indicates inaccessible SNP information for a particular location

The dataset covers Chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, and mitochondrial DNA.

## Analysis Details
The Python notebook provided in this repository performs analysis on the genome sequencing data. It explores various aspects of the genome, including but not limited to:
- Identification of genetic variations
- Analysis of SNP patterns
- Inference of biological traits and susceptibilities
- Visualization of genomic data

## Repository Structure
- `genome_sequencing_analysis.ipynb`: Python notebook containing the analysis code.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage
To explore the analysis and results, simply open the `genome_sequencing_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment or any compatible platform.
